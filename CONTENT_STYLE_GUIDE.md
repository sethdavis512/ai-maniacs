# Content Style Guide

Internal reference for maintaining consistent voice, tone, and composition across all AI Maniacs content.

## Voice and Tone Framework

### Core Voice: "Expert Guide"

**Characteristics:**
- Authoritative but approachable
- Confident without being arrogant  
- Encouraging but realistic about challenges
- Professional but not academic

### Tone Guidelines

**Warmth Level: Professional Friendly**

- Acknowledge challenges without dwelling on them
- Celebrate progress at appropriate milestones
- Avoid overly casual language or excessive enthusiasm

**Authority Level: Confident Expert**
- Make clear statements about what works and what doesn't
- Provide reasoning behind recommendations
- Don't hedge unnecessarily with "maybe" or "might"

**Encouragement Level: Supportive Realist**
- Acknowledge that learning takes time and practice
- Provide reassurance about common struggles
- Focus on practical next steps rather than motivational speeches
