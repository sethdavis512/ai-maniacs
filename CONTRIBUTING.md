- **Current information**: Reference up-to-date tools and practices

### Writing Style

- **Clear and conversational**: Write like you're teaching a friend
- **Use examples**: Relate concepts to familiar experiences
- **Define terms**: Explain technical terms when first introduced
- **Be inclusive**: Use language welcoming to all backgrounds
- **Stay factual**: Distinguish between facts and opinions

### Content Structure

```markdown
---
sidebar_position: N  # Required for lesson ordering
---

# Lesson Title

### AI Content Transparency

When content is created with AI assistance, include this warning:

```markdown
:::warning
Content created with AI assistance - may contain errors or become outdated.
:::
```

## üîß Technical Guidelines

### File Organization

- **Course content**: Add to appropriate `docs/` subfolder
- **Lesson ordering**: Use `sidebar_position: N` in frontmatter
- **Assets**: Add images to `static/img/` with descriptive names
- **Categories**: Update `_category_.json` for new sections

### Link Management

- **Internal links**: Use relative paths (`./filename.md`, `../folder/filename.md`)
- **No directory links**: Always link to specific `.md` files
- **Cross-references**: Link to related lessons appropriately
- **External links**: Include for tools and resources mentioned

### Common Issues to Avoid

- **MDX parsing**: Don't use `<5%` - write "under 5%" instead
- **Broken links**: Test with `yarn build` before submitting
- **Missing positions**: Include `sidebar_position` in all lesson files
- **Large files**: Optimize images and avoid oversized assets
