# AI 101: Your Gateway to Artificial Intelligence

AI 101 transforms complete beginners into confident AI users through hands-on learning and practical application. This course requires no technical background and builds your knowledge systematically from basic concepts to real-world implementation.

## Learning Focus

By completing AI 101, you'll develop four core competencies that enable effective AI use:

**Foundational Understanding** - You'll grasp what AI actually is, how large language models work, and why different AI tools excel at different tasks. This knowledge helps you choose appropriate tools and set realistic expectations for AI capabilities.

**Practical Skills** - You'll become proficient with major AI platforms, write effective prompts that consistently produce good results, and troubleshoot common issues. These skills transfer across different AI tools and platforms.

**Safe Application** - You'll understand how to protect sensitive information, recognize potential biases in AI outputs, and verify AI-generated content before using it. Responsible AI use is integrated throughout the course, not treated as an afterthought.

**Strategic Integration** - You'll learn to incorporate AI into existing workflows, choose appropriate tools for specific tasks, and develop sustainable practices for ongoing AI use in work and personal projects.

## Course Structure

The course progresses through six modules that build systematically from basic concepts to advanced application. Each module combines explanation with hands-on practice using real AI tools.

**Foundations** establishes your understanding of what AI is, how large language models work, and the different types of AI models you'll encounter. This knowledge foundation supports everything that follows.

**Companies and Tools** explores the current AI landscape and teaches you how to evaluate and choose appropriate tools for different tasks. You'll understand the strengths and limitations of major AI platforms.

**Applications** provides hands-on experience with AI for text creation, visual content, and audio/video projects. You'll work with actual tools to complete realistic projects that demonstrate AI capabilities.

**Safety and Ethics** integrates responsible AI practices into your workflow. You'll learn to protect sensitive information, recognize bias, and verify AI outputs before using them in important contexts.

**Best Practices** develops your prompt engineering skills and quality control techniques. These advanced skills help you get consistent, high-quality results from any AI tool.

**Community and Next Steps** connects you with ongoing learning resources and prepares you for more advanced AI applications through AI 201 or specialized career tracks.

## Learning Approach

This course emphasizes learning by doing rather than theoretical study. Every concept includes practical exercises you can complete immediately using free or accessible AI tools. Each lesson builds directly on previous knowledge, so you develop genuine competence rather than superficial familiarity.

You'll work with actual AI platforms from day one, learning to navigate real interfaces and solve authentic problems. This hands-on approach builds confidence and practical skills that transfer directly to your work or personal projects.

Safety and ethics considerations are integrated throughout rather than relegated to a single module. You'll develop responsible AI habits from the beginning, making ethical use natural rather than an afterthought.

## Getting Started

AI 101 requires only basic computer skills and curiosity about AI technology. You don't need programming knowledge, advanced mathematics, or previous AI experience. The course takes 8-12 hours to complete over 4-6 weeks, with each lesson requiring 30-45 minutes including exercises.

You can complete the course at your own pace, though we recommend 2-3 hours of practice per week to maintain momentum and reinforce learning. All exercises use free or low-cost AI tools, so you can explore without significant financial investment.

## Key Takeaways

- AI 101 transforms beginners into confident AI users through practical, hands-on learning
- The course integrates safety and ethics throughout rather than treating them as separate topics  
- You'll develop transferable skills that work across different AI platforms and tools
- Progressive difficulty ensures you build genuine competence at each stage
- Real-world exercises prepare you for immediate application in work or personal projects
