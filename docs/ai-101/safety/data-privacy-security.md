# Data Privacy & Security When Using AI

Your data privacy and security should be top priorities when using AI tools. This lesson covers what you need to know to protect yourself and your information.

## What Data Do AI Companies Collect?

### Input Data

**What you share**:

- Text you type in conversations
- Images you upload for analysis
- Files you share for processing
- Voice recordings (for speech AI)
- Personal information you mention

**How it's used**:

- To generate responses to your queries
- To improve the AI model (sometimes)
- For safety and abuse monitoring
- For service analytics and debugging

### Usage Data

**What's tracked**:

- When you use the service
- How long your sessions last
- Which features you use most
- Your general location (country/region)
- Device and browser information

### Account Data

**What's stored**:

- Email address and username
- Billing information (for paid services)
- Conversation history
- Preferences and settings
- Subscription status

## Understanding Privacy Policies

### Key Questions to Ask

1. **Data Retention**: How long is my data kept?
2. **Data Usage**: Is my data used to train the AI?
3. **Data Sharing**: Is my data shared with third parties?
4. **Data Location**: Where is my data stored geographically?
5. **Data Control**: Can I delete my data?

### Safe Alternatives and Practices

#### Anonymization Techniques

**Instead of**: "My client John Smith from ABC Corp needs help with his contract"
**Use**: "A client needs help understanding contract terms for a software licensing agreement"

**Instead of**: "I work at [Company Name] and our revenue last quarter was $X"
**Use**: "A mid-size tech company with quarterly revenue around $X needs help with analysis"

#### Data Sanitization

- Remove names, addresses, and phone numbers
- Replace specific companies with "Company A" or industry type
- Use placeholder dates instead of specific ones
- Remove financial specifics when possible

#### Work-Safe Practices

- Use generic examples instead of real cases
- Focus on concepts rather than specific implementations
- Create hypothetical scenarios based on real situations
- Avoid copy-pasting sensitive documents

## Enterprise vs Personal Use Considerations

### Personal Use

**Risks**:

- Data may be used for model training
- Less control over data retention
- Minimal legal protections
- Shared infrastructure

**Best Practices**:

## Data Retention and Deletion Policies

### Understanding Retention Periods

**Immediate Deletion**

- Some services allow immediate conversation deletion
- May still retain data for short periods for safety/abuse monitoring

**Standard Retention**

- 30-90 days is common for conversation data
- Account data may be retained longer
- Billing data kept for legal/tax requirements

**Long-term Retention**

- Some aggregated/anonymized data may be kept indefinitely
- Model training data typically kept permanently
- Legal compliance may require certain data retention
