## Best Practices for Visual AI

### Effective Prompting for Images

**Be Specific About Style**

❌ "A cat"
✅ "A fluffy orange tabby cat sitting in a sunny window, photographic style, shallow depth of field"

**Include Technical Details**

- Lighting: "soft natural lighting", "golden hour", "studio lighting"
- Camera angle: "bird's eye view", "close-up portrait", "wide establishing shot"
- Style: "photorealistic", "watercolor painting", "digital art", "vintage film"

**Specify Composition**

- "centered composition"
- "rule of thirds"
- "negative space on the left"
- "foreground, middle ground, background"

### Quality Control

**Check for Common Issues**

- Text legibility in generated images
- Anatomical accuracy for people and animals
- Consistent lighting and shadows
- Object placement and scale
- Brand safety and appropriateness

**Iteration Strategy**

1. Start with a basic prompt
2. Generate multiple variations
3. Identify the best elements
4. Refine prompt with specific improvements
5. Test different seed values or settings

### Legal and Ethical Considerations

**Copyright and Licensing**

- Understand each platform's usage rights
- Check commercial licensing terms
- Consider copyright implications of training data
- Document AI-generated content for transparency

**Attribution and Disclosure**

- Disclose AI-generated content when required
- Credit the AI tool used
- Follow platform-specific guidelines
- Maintain ethical standards in representation

## Integration with Workflows

### Design Workflows

**Concept Development**

1. Generate initial concepts with AI
2. Refine promising directions
3. Use traditional tools for final polish
4. Combine AI and human creativity

**Asset Creation Pipeline**

- Mood boards and style exploration
- Rapid prototyping and iteration
- Background and texture generation
- Final production enhancement

### Content Marketing

**Batch Content Creation**

- Generate multiple variations quickly
- A/B test different visual approaches
- Maintain consistent brand aesthetic
- Scale content production efficiently

## Advanced Techniques

### Prompt Engineering for Visuals

**Negative Prompts**

Specify what you DON'T want:
"beautiful landscape --no people, buildings, text, watermarks"

**Weight and Emphasis**

- Use parentheses for emphasis: "(ultra detailed)"
- Specify importance ratios: "mountains:1.5, lake:0.8"

**Style Blending**

"Portrait in the style of (Renaissance painting:0.7) + (modern photography:0.3)"

### Consistency Techniques

**Character Consistency**

- Develop detailed character descriptions
- Use reference images when possible
- Maintain consistent lighting and angle
- Document successful prompt formulas

**Brand Consistency**

- Create style guides for AI generation
- Use consistent color palettes
- Maintain brand voice in visual style
- Test and refine brand-specific prompts
