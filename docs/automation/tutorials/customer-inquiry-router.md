# Build a Smart Customer Inquiry Router

Create an intelligent automation that reads customer emails and routes them to the right team members based on content and urgency. This tutorial introduces conditional logic and demonstrates how automation can make decisions, not just move data.

You'll build a system that ensures customer inquiries reach appropriate specialists quickly while maintaining detailed tracking for follow-up and analysis.

## What You'll Learn

- **Implement conditional logic** to make automation decisions based on email content
- **Set up multi-path workflows** that route messages to different team members
- **Use text analysis** to categorize inquiries automatically
- **Create escalation rules** for urgent or high-value customers

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- Gmail or Outlook account with customer emails
- Slack workspace or Microsoft Teams access
- Zapier account (free plan works for testing)
- Access to team member contact information
- 20 minutes for setup and testing

## The Business Challenge

Customer inquiries arrive at all hours covering different topics: technical support, billing questions, sales requests, and general information. Without proper routing, important messages get delayed, customers wait for responses, and team members waste time handling inquiries outside their expertise.

This automation categorizes inquiries and routes them instantly to appropriate specialists.

## Step 1: Plan Your Routing Logic

Before building automation, define clear routing rules:

**Category Definitions**:
- **Technical Support**: Keywords like "error," "bug," "not working," "help"
- **Sales**: Keywords like "pricing," "demo," "purchase," "quote"
- **Billing**: Keywords like "invoice," "payment," "refund," "billing"
- **General**: Everything else or multiple categories

**Priority Levels**:
- **High**: Emails from VIP customers or containing "urgent," "critical"
- **Medium**: Standard business inquiries
- **Low**: General information requests

**Team Assignments**:
- Technical Support → Support team channel/members
- Sales → Sales team channel/members  
- Billing → Finance team channel/members
- General → Customer service team

## Step 2: Set Up Email Parsing

Create automation that analyzes incoming customer emails:

**Create New Zap**: Name it "Customer Inquiry Router" for clear identification.

**Configure Email Trigger**: Set up Gmail or Outlook to trigger on emails to your customer service address (support@company.com, help@company.com, etc.).

**Add Email Parser**: Use Zapier's built-in text analysis or add a "Formatter" step to extract key information:
- Sender email domain (to identify VIP customers)
- Subject line keywords
- Email body text for content analysis
- Time received for urgency assessment

## Step 3: Build Classification Logic

Add conditional logic to categorize inquiries automatically:

**Add Filter Steps**: Create multiple filter paths based on email content:

**Technical Support Filter**:
- Email body contains: "error" OR "bug" OR "not working" OR "technical" OR "login"
- Route to: Technical support team

**Sales Filter**:
- Email body contains: "price" OR "demo" OR "sales" OR "purchase" OR "upgrade"
- Route to: Sales team

**Billing Filter**:
- Email body contains: "invoice" OR "payment" OR "billing" OR "refund" OR "charge"
- Route to: Finance team

**Priority Assessment**: Add another filter layer to identify urgent inquiries:
- High priority: VIP customer domains OR subject contains "urgent" OR "critical"
- Medium priority: Standard business hours
- Low priority: Off-hours or general information

## Step 4: Configure Team Routing

Set up actions that notify appropriate team members:

**Slack Integration**: For each inquiry category, create Slack channel notifications:

**Technical Support Route**:
- Channel: #technical-support
- Message: "New technical inquiry from [Customer Name] - Priority: [High/Medium/Low]"
- Include: Original email content, sender information, timestamp

**Sales Route**:
- Channel: #sales-leads  
- Message: "New sales inquiry from [Customer Name] - Potential opportunity"
- Include: Company information, inquiry details, contact information

**Billing Route**:
- Channel: #billing-support
- Message: "New billing inquiry from [Customer Name] - Action needed"
- Include: Account details, inquiry type, urgency level

**High Priority Escalation**: For urgent inquiries, add direct message notifications to team leads or managers.

## Step 5: Create Tracking and Follow-Up

Ensure every inquiry gets tracked and nothing falls through cracks:

**Add to Tracking Spreadsheet**: Create Google Sheets entries for all inquiries with:
- Timestamp received
- Customer information  
- Inquiry category
- Priority level
- Assigned team
- Status (new/in progress/resolved)

**Set Follow-Up Reminders**: Use Zapier's delay feature to create automatic follow-up reminders:
- 2 hours: Check if inquiry acknowledged
- 24 hours: Verify response sent
- 72 hours: Ensure resolution or escalation

**Customer Acknowledgment**: Send automatic acknowledgment emails:
"Thank you for contacting us. Your inquiry has been routed to our [team name] and you'll receive a response within [timeframe]."

## Step 6: Test Your Router

Thoroughly test automation with realistic scenarios:

**Send Test Emails**: Create sample emails for each category:
- Technical: "I'm getting an error message when trying to login"
- Sales: "Can you send me pricing information for your enterprise plan?"
- Billing: "I have a question about last month's invoice"
- Urgent: "URGENT: Our system is down and we need immediate help"

**Verify Routing**: Confirm each test email:
- Triggers the automation correctly
- Gets categorized appropriately
- Routes to the right team channel
- Creates proper tracking entries
- Sends customer acknowledgments

**Check Edge Cases**: Test emails with:
- Multiple categories (technical + urgent)
- Unclear content that should route to general team
- VIP customers from known domains
- Off-hours submissions

## Step 7: Monitor and Optimize

Establish processes for ongoing improvement:

**Weekly Reviews**: Analyze routing accuracy and adjust keywords based on missed categorizations.

**Team Feedback**: Collect input from team members about routing quality and suggested improvements.

**Response Time Tracking**: Monitor how quickly teams respond to different inquiry types and adjust priority rules accordingly.

**Customer Satisfaction**: Track whether customers feel their inquiries reach appropriate specialists quickly.

## Advanced Enhancements

Once comfortable with basic routing, consider these improvements:

**AI-Powered Classification**: Integrate OpenAI or similar services for more sophisticated content analysis beyond keyword matching.

**Customer Database Integration**: Connect to your CRM to identify VIP customers automatically and provide context to team members.

**Automatic Response Suggestions**: Generate draft responses based on inquiry category and customer history.

**Escalation Workflows**: Create automatic escalation for inquiries that remain unresolved after specified timeframes.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Incorrect Categorization**: Refine keywords and add more specific filter criteria. Consider using multiple keywords with AND/OR logic.

**Missing Notifications**: Check Slack permissions and ensure team members have access to designated channels.

**Delayed Processing**: Verify trigger settings and consider upgrading Zapier plan for faster processing if needed.

**Overwhelmed Teams**: Adjust routing logic to better balance workload across team members or create sub-specializations.

## Measuring Success

Track these metrics to evaluate automation effectiveness:

**Routing Accuracy**: Percentage of inquiries correctly categorized (target: 85%+)

**Response Time**: Average time from inquiry receipt to team acknowledgment (target: <2 hours during business hours)

**Customer Satisfaction**: Feedback scores on inquiry handling and resolution speed

**Team Efficiency**: Reduction in time spent manually triaging and routing customer emails

## Key Takeaways

- **Conditional logic enables smart automation**: Rules-based routing handles most customer inquiries without human intervention
- **Testing reveals edge cases**: Thorough testing with realistic scenarios identifies routing gaps before going live
- **Monitoring drives improvement**: Regular analysis and adjustment improve routing accuracy over time
- **Team feedback is essential**: Input from team members helps refine routing rules and identify optimization opportunities
- **Start simple, add complexity gradually**: Begin with basic keyword routing and enhance with more sophisticated logic as needed
