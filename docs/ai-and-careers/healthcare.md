## Overview

Healthcare professionals are uniquely positioned to benefit from AI tools while maintaining the highest standards of patient care and confidentiality. This guide covers practical applications that can enhance your efficiency without compromising quality or safety.

## Key Applications

### Clinical Documentation

**Use Case**: Streamline patient notes and medical records

**Recommended Tools**:

- **Dragon Medical One**: Voice-to-text specifically for healthcare
- **ChatGPT/Claude**: Assistance with documentation structure (non-confidential)
- **Notion AI**: Organize clinical notes and templates

**Example Prompts**:

```
"Help me structure a SOAP note template for routine follow-up visits"

"Create a checklist for pre-operative patient education covering [specific procedure]"

"Generate a template for discharge instructions that includes medication compliance reminders"
```

### Differential Diagnosis Support

**Use Case**: Brainstorm possible diagnoses based on symptoms

**Recommended Tools**:

- **Perplexity**: Research latest medical literature
- **ChatGPT Plus**: Access to browse function for current guidelines
- **UpToDate AI**: Medical decision support (if available)

**Example Prompts**:

```
"Patient presents with [symptoms]. What are the most common differential diagnoses to consider? Please provide evidence-based reasoning."

"What are the red flag symptoms for [condition] that would require immediate intervention?"

"Summarize the latest clinical guidelines for managing [specific condition]"
```

:::danger Important Safety Note
AI should NEVER replace clinical judgment. Always verify AI suggestions with current medical literature and colleague consultation. Never input patient-identifying information into general AI tools.
