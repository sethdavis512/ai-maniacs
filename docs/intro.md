# Welcome to AI Maniacs (2026 Edition)

Welcome to **AI Maniacs** - your practical guide to AI agents, autonomous systems, and the modern AI landscape. Updated for 2026.

:::info What's Changed Since You Were Last Here
AI has evolved from chat interfaces to **autonomous agents** that complete tasks independently. If you learned AI in 2023-2024, much has changed. This course reflects the current reality: agents, skills, and delegation over prompting.
:::

## What You'll Learn

**If you're new to AI:**
- How AI agents work (they do tasks, not just answer questions)
- Building your first autonomous workflows
- Using tools like Claude Code, Cursor, and Perplexity
- Creating custom AI skills for your needs
- Safe, ethical AI use in professional settings

**If you used AI before 2026:**
- The shift from chat → agents
- New tools: Cursor, Claude Code, v0.dev, Bolt.new
- Skills ecosystem and customization
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) for tool integration
- Multi-agent orchestration

## Course Structure

**Updated for 2026:**

1. **🧠 AI 101: Foundations** - Core concepts (updated for 2026 capabilities)
2. **🤖 AI Agents** ⭐ NEW - Autonomous AI systems and workflows
3. **🏢 AI Tools & Platforms** - Current landscape (Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT-4.5, Gemini 2.0)
4. **⚡ Practical Applications** - Real-world agent implementations
5. **🔧 Automation** - Agent-first workflow design
6. **💼 AI and Careers** - Industry-specific AI stacks
7. **🎓 AI Power User** (was AI 201) - Advanced techniques
8. **🔌 Model Context Protocol (MCP)** - Connect AI to tools and data

## Start Here (2026 Recommendations)

### Path 1: "I'm Brand New to AI"

1. Start with [What is AI?](./ai-101/foundations/what-is-ai.md) to build foundation
2. Try [Claude](https://claude.ai) or [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) (both free)
3. Give it a real task: "Research X and create a summary document"
4. Jump to [AI Agents Overview](./ai-agents/index.md) to see what's possible
5. Browse [50+ Agent Use Cases](./ai-agents/use-cases.md) for ideas

### Path 2: "I Used ChatGPT in 2023-2024"

1. Read [AI Agents Overview](./ai-agents/index.md) to understand the shift
2. Check [Tools & Platforms 2026](./ai-resources/tools-platforms.md) for what's new
3. Try **Claude Sonnet 4.5** or **GPT-4.5** (both much better now)
4. Learn about [Skills & Instructions](./ai-agents/skills-instructions.md)
5. Build your first agent from [Use Cases](./ai-agents/use-cases.md)

### Path 3: "I'm a Developer"

1. Install [Cursor](https://cursor.sh) immediately (most popular AI IDE)
2. Try [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) in terminal
3. Experiment with [v0.dev](https://v0.dev) or [Bolt.new](https://bolt.new)
4. Learn [MCP](./model-context-protocol/introduction.md) for tool integration
5. Build an agent with [LangGraph](https://langchain.com) or [Claude SDK](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-agent-sdk)

### Path 4: "I Want to Build Systems"

1. Understand [Agent Patterns](./ai-agents/agent-patterns.md)
2. Learn [MCP Integration](./ai-agents/mcp-integration.md)
3. Explore [Multi-Agent Systems](./ai-agents/multi-agent-systems.md)
4. Study [Agent Safety](./ai-agents/agent-safety.md)
5. Choose no-code (Relevance AI, Lindy) or code (LangGraph, CrewAI)

## Key 2026 Concepts

**Agents > Assistants**
Stop thinking "What should I ask AI?" Start thinking "What should I delegate to an agent?"

**Skills Ecosystem**
Extend AI with custom capabilities via [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) and custom instructions

**MCP Standard**
Connect AI to tools, databases, and APIs using the industry-standard protocol

**Context is Huge**
200K-2M token windows mean you can give AI entire codebases, document sets, or conversation histories

**Multi-Modal Default**
Text, images, audio, video - all in one interface, no special modes needed

## What's Different in 2026

**Then (2023-2024):**
- Chat interface only
- Copy/paste outputs
- Limited context (4K-32K tokens)
- Hallucinations common
- One-shot responses

**Now (2026):**
- Autonomous agents
- End-to-end task completion
- Massive context (200K-2M tokens)
- Tool use and verification
- Multi-turn reasoning

**The shift:** From "AI helps me work" to "AI works for me"
