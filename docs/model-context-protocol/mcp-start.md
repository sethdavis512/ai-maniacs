# MCP Introduction

This page introduces the Model Context Protocol (MCP): a lightweight, composable approach for packaging, transmitting, and applying contextual information to models so their behavior is predictable, auditable, and reusable across systems.

### What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a set of conventions and data shapes for describing the context a model should use when producing outputs. Context here includes dynamic application state, user intent, relevant documents, tool descriptions, and policy constraints. MCP is intentionally implementation-agnostic — it's a contract (schema + behavior hints) that systems agree upon so the same context can be shared across services, adapters, and model runtimes.

Key aspects:

- Explicit context objects (metadata, documents, instructions, tools)
- Versioned schemas so consumers can validate and interpret context reliably
- Clear rules for precedence and merging when multiple contexts apply
- Lightweight transport-friendly format (JSON / JSON-LD / proxied binary blobs)

### Why use MCP?

- Predictability: Models behave more consistently when given well-structured context.
- Reusability: Context packages can be shared between components (UI, orchestrators, agents) and reused across sessions.
- Auditability: Structured context makes it easier to log, trace, and review why a model produced a particular output.
- Interoperability: Different tools and model providers can cooperate if they speak the same context protocol.

### Common MCP Components

- identity: user, session, role, permissions
- instructions: system-level directives, role prompts, safety overrides
- documents: short summaries, long reference files, embeddings or pointers
- tools: descriptions of available actions/endpoints and their I/O
- preferences: user or application preferences that influence style/format
- constraints: timeouts, cost limits, safety/policy rules

Each component should be small, named, and typed so downstream systems can validate and apply them safely.

### How MCP is typically leveraged

1. UI / Application layer packages context: The app collects user settings, recent messages, and relevant files and composes an MCP package.
2. Orchestrator or agent merges contexts: If multiple sources provide context (user + system + tool), a deterministic merge policy creates the final context bundle.
3. Adapter or runtime transforms for the model: The MCP package is transformed into the model’s expected prompt/input format (e.g., flattened prompt, instruction tokens, or API-specific fields).
4. Model runs and returns outputs: Outputs are returned alongside references to the context used (context id/version), enabling replay and audit.
5. Logger or storage saves context snapshot: For traceability, the exact MCP bundle used for a request is stored with the output.

### Integration patterns

- Prompt-time mapping: Convert MCP components into parts of a single prompt template (system, user, assistant blocks).
- Streaming enrichments: Attach small MCP markers that allow the runtime to fetch larger documents on-demand.
- Tool-aware invocation: Include tool descriptions in MCP so agents can plan and call tools safely.
- Embedding pointers: MCP can reference pre-computed embeddings instead of raw documents for semantic retrieval.

### Data shape (example)

```json
{
  "context_id": "ctx_2025_08_15_001",
  "version": "1.0",
  "identity": { "user_id": "user_123", "roles": ["editor"] },
  "instructions": { "system": "You are a helpful assistant.", "style": "concise" },
  "documents": [ { "id": "doc_1", "type": "summary", "pointer": "s3://..." } ],
  "tools": [ { "name": "search", "schema": { "q": "string" } } ],
  "constraints": { "max_cost": 0.05, "safety": "strict" }
}
```

This small, typed package can be validated before being passed to any model adapter.

### Edge cases & pitfalls

- Overly large context bundles increase latency and cost. Prefer pointers/embeddings for big reference sets.
- Ambiguous merge rules: define explicit precedence (system > app > user) and document it.
- Privacy: context may contain PII; encrypt or redact fields where required and log access.
- Drift: keep schema versions and migrations so old context packages remain interpretable.

### Security & governance

- Validate and sanitize all context fields before use.
- Enforce policy constraints from a central policy engine included as part of MCP (e.g., a `constraints.policy` block).
- Record cryptographic hashes of sensitive context packages for tamper-evident audit trails.

### Example uses in AI systems

- Virtual assistants: supply long-term user preferences and short-term session history as MCP to improve continuity.
- Enterprise apps: attach compliance rules and document pointers for model responses in regulated domains.
- Multi-agent systems: agents exchange MCP bundles to collaborate on tasks while keeping a shared, auditable state.

### Quick implementation checklist

- Define a minimal MCP schema for your product (identity, instructions, docs, constraints).
- Implement a serializer + validator for the schema.
- Add deterministic merge rules and document precedence.
- Log context_id and version with model calls for traceability.

### Further reading & resources

- Design patterns: context as a first-class object in agent systems
- Schemas: JSON Schema / OpenAPI for typing MCP components
- Storage: efficient pointers (S3, DB ids) versus embedding storage

### Exercises (for learners)

1. Draft a minimal MCP JSON for a simple task: email summarization.
2. Implement a merge function that combines system, app, and user contexts with clear precedence.
3. Convert an MCP package into a single prompt template for a chosen model API.

This introduction is intentionally concrete and practical — the goal is to make context explicit, versioned, and reusable so models behave reliably in production systems.
