# Welcome to Pre-AI Foundations

Before diving into AI, let's make sure you have the foundation you need to succeed. This short module ensures everyone starts on equal footing, regardless of your technical background. Think of this as your "AI readiness checklist."

## Who This Module Is For

This module is perfect if you're completely new to technology, feel uncertain about digital tools, or want to understand the basic concepts that make AI work. It's also ideal if you haven't worked with data, statistics, or mathematical concepts recently and prefer to start with solid fundamentals before jumping into AI.

You can skip this module if you're already comfortable with web applications and online accounts, understand basic statistics like averages and probability, have experience with digital files and cloud storage, and are ready to dive straight into AI concepts.

## What You'll Learn

**Digital Literacy Foundations** will cover setting up accounts and managing passwords safely, understanding the difference between web applications and downloaded software, basic file management and organization, and an introduction to cloud services and data storage.

**Math Concepts for AI** takes a "no fear" approach to explaining statistics in everyday language, covering averages, patterns, and probability. You'll learn what "data" really means and how computers use it, understand concepts like accuracy, confidence, and uncertainty, and discover how computers "learn" from examples.

**Technology Comfort Building** focuses on approaching new digital tools without anxiety, basic troubleshooting strategies, understanding common technology terms you'll encounter, and building confidence through trial and error.

The **AI Readiness Assessment** includes a self-evaluation to identify your strengths, a preview of what's coming in AI 101, guidance on choosing your learning path based on your background, and help setting realistic expectations and goals.

## Your Learning Journey

This Pre-AI Foundations course leads directly into AI 101: Using AI for Beginners, which then progresses to AI 201: Advanced AI Applications, and finally to AI and Careers: Industry Applications.

The estimated time for this module is 2-3 hours total, presented in short, practical lessons with hands-on activities. You can go at your own pace - there's no rush.

## Ready to Begin?

Remember that everyone starts somewhere. This foundation will give you confidence and ensure you get the most out of your AI learning journey. Don't worry about understanding everything perfectly - the goal is familiarity and comfort, not mastery. You'll use these concepts throughout your AI journey.
