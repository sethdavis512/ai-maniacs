## Few-Shot Learning Techniques

### Pattern Recognition Examples

Train AI through strategic examples:

```text
I'll show you how to convert technical features into customer benefits:

Example 1:
Feature: "256-bit encryption"
Benefit: "Your sensitive data stays completely secure, giving you peace of mind when storing confidential information."

Example 2:  
Feature: "99.9% uptime guarantee"
Benefit: "Your business stays operational 24/7, so you never lose revenue due to system downtime."

Example 3:
Feature: "Sub-second response times"
Benefit: "Your customers get instant results, creating a smooth experience that keeps them engaged."

Now convert these features to benefits:
Feature: "Automated backup every 15 minutes"
Feature: "Advanced spam filtering with machine learning"
Feature: "Single sign-on integration with 200+ apps"
```

### Style Transfer Examples

Teach AI specific writing styles:

```text
Transform this content to match different communication styles:

Original: "The system experienced an unexpected error during the update process."

Formal Business Style:
"We encountered a technical issue while implementing the latest system updates. Our team is working to resolve this matter promptly."

Casual User-Friendly Style:  
"Oops! Something went wrong during the update. Don't worry - we're on it and should have things back to normal soon."

Technical Documentation Style:
"Error Code 401: Update process terminated unexpectedly. Check system logs for detailed diagnostic information."

Now transform this message to match each style:
"The new feature will be available next month."
```

## Constraint-Based Prompting

### Output Control Techniques

**Format Constraints:**

```text
Provide a product comparison in exactly this format:

| Feature | Product A | Product B | Winner |
|---------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| [Feature] | [Rating/Description] | [Rating/Description] | [A/B/Tie] |

Include exactly 5 features.
Use ratings from 1-5 where applicable.
Keep descriptions under 10 words each.
```

**Content Constraints:**

```text
Write a social media strategy that includes:
- Exactly 3 platform recommendations (not more, not less)
- 2 content themes per platform
- 1 specific metric to track per platform
- Budget allocation in percentages that sum to 100%
- Timeline spanning exactly 6 months

Do not include:
- Generic advice like "post regularly"
- Platforms with less than 100M users
- Metrics that can't be measured weekly
```

### Persona-Based Constraints

Create consistent character-driven responses:

```text
You are Dr. Sarah Chen, a data scientist with the following characteristics:
- PhD in Machine Learning from Stanford
- 8 years at Google, now consulting
- Explains complex concepts through everyday analogies
- Always emphasizes practical implementation
- Slightly impatient with theoretical debates
- Prefers Python over R, pragmatic about tool choices

A startup CEO asks: "Should we build our own recommendation engine or use an existing service?"

Respond as Dr. Chen would, including:
- Her typical analogies and communication style
- Reference to her experience (without being boastful)
- Practical next steps
- At least one specific tool or service recommendation
```

## Meta-Prompting Techniques

### Self-Improving Prompts

Make AI improve its own responses:

```text
Generate a marketing email for our new project management tool.

After writing the email, critique it by:
1. Identifying weak points in the messaging
2. Suggesting specific improvements
3. Rewriting problematic sections

Then provide the improved version.
```

### Multi-Perspective Analysis

Get comprehensive viewpoints:

```text
Analyze this business decision from multiple perspectives:

Decision: "Should we switch from annual to monthly pricing for our software?"

Perspectives to consider:
1. CFO viewpoint (cash flow, revenue recognition)
2. Sales team viewpoint (closing deals, customer objections)  
3. Customer success viewpoint (retention, satisfaction)
4. Marketing viewpoint (positioning, competition)
5. Customer viewpoint (budget flexibility, commitment)

For each perspective:
- List top 3 concerns
- Identify primary benefits
- Suggest specific questions to investigate
- Recommend data to gather
```

## Advanced Output Formatting

### Structured Data Generation

Generate consistent, processable outputs:

```text
Extract information from this customer support conversation and return it in this exact JSON structure:

{
  "issue_category": "technical|billing|feature_request|other",
  "urgency_level": 1-5,
  "customer_sentiment": "positive|neutral|negative",
  "resolution_status": "resolved|pending|escalated",
  "follow_up_required": true|false,
  "key_points": ["point1", "point2", "point3"],
  "suggested_actions": ["action1", "action2"]
}

Conversation: [paste conversation here]
```

### Multi-Format Outputs

Generate content in multiple formats simultaneously:

```text
Create content about "sustainable packaging" in these formats:

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (100 words)
   - Key points only
   - Business-focused language
   - ROI implications

2. BLOG POST INTRO (200 words)
   - Engaging hook
   - Problem statement
   - Preview of solutions

3. SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS (3 versions)
   - LinkedIn (professional tone)
   - Twitter (concise, hashtags)
   - Instagram (visual-focused caption)

4. EMAIL SUBJECT LINES (5 options)
   - A/B test variations
   - Different angles/emotions
```

## Quality Assurance Prompting

### Built-in Verification

Include quality checks in prompts:

```text
Write a technical documentation section explaining API authentication.

After writing, verify your response includes:
✓ Code examples in at least 2 programming languages
✓ Common error scenarios and solutions  
✓ Security best practices mentioned
✓ Step-by-step implementation guide
✓ Links to relevant documentation (use placeholder URLs)

If any items are missing, add them before providing your final response.
```

### Iterative Refinement

Build improvement loops into prompts:

```text
Design a customer onboarding flow for a SaaS product.

Step 1: Create initial flow design
Step 2: Identify potential friction points
Step 3: Suggest improvements for each friction point
Step 4: Redesign the flow incorporating improvements
Step 5: Validate the final design against these criteria:
   - Time to first value under 10 minutes
   - No more than 5 required steps
   - Clear progress indicators
   - Multiple exit/retry options
```

## Industry-Specific Prompting

### Compliance-Aware Prompting

For regulated industries:
