## üìã Comprehensive Knowledge Check

### Section 1: Advanced AI Foundations

**1. How do different model architectures (transformer, diffusion, etc.) affect AI capabilities?**

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

- **Transformers**: Excel at language tasks through attention mechanisms, enabling parallel processing and long-range dependencies
- **Diffusion Models**: Generate high-quality images by learning to reverse noise corruption
- **Convolutional Neural Networks**: Ideal for image recognition through spatial pattern recognition
- **Recurrent Neural Networks**: Good for sequential data but limited by sequential processing constraints

Each architecture is optimized for specific data types and tasks.
</details>

**2. What is the relationship between training data, model bias, and output quality?**

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

Training data directly shapes model behavior:

- **Data quality** determines output accuracy and reliability
- **Data bias** (demographic, cultural, temporal) gets encoded into model responses
- **Data scale** affects model capabilities and generalization
- **Data recency** impacts knowledge of current events and trends

Higher quality, diverse, recent training data generally produces better, less biased outputs.
</details>

**3. When should you use fine-tuning vs. prompt engineering vs. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?**

a) Fine-tuning for all custom applications  
b) Prompt engineering only for simple tasks  
c) Choose based on data availability, update frequency, and performance requirements  
d) RAG only for search applications  

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>
**Answer: c) Choose based on data availability, update frequency, and performance requirements**

- **Prompt Engineering**: First try - low cost, fast iteration, good for many tasks
- **RAG**: When you need current/private data, frequent updates, or source citations
- **Fine-tuning**: When you need specialized behavior, have quality training data, and can justify the cost

</details>

### Section 2: Workflow Automation & Integration

**4. What are the key considerations when integrating AI into existing business workflows?**

<details>
<summary>Example considerations</summary>

- **Data security and privacy compliance**
- **User training and change management**
- **API rate limits and cost management**
- **Fallback procedures for AI failures**
- **Quality control and human oversight**
- **Integration with existing tools and databases**
- **Performance monitoring and optimization**

</details>

**5. Design an API integration strategy for a customer service AI assistant.**

<details>
<summary>Key components</summary>

- **Authentication**: Secure API key management
- **Rate limiting**: Handle request throttling gracefully
- **Error handling**: Retry logic, fallback responses
- **Data flow**: Customer query ‚Üí context retrieval ‚Üí AI processing ‚Üí response formatting
- **Monitoring**: Track usage, performance, and costs
- **Privacy**: Data encryption, PII handling, retention policies

</details>

### Section 3: Advanced Ethics & Governance

**6. How do you implement AI governance in an enterprise setting?**

<details>
<summary>Core elements</summary>

- **AI Ethics Committee**: Cross-functional oversight body
- **Risk Assessment Framework**: Evaluate AI applications for potential harms
- **Audit Trail**: Document AI decisions and data usage
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Ensure adherence to regulations (GDPR, etc.)
- **Vendor Management**: Evaluate third-party AI providers
- **Incident Response**: Process for handling AI failures or bias issues

</details>

**7. What is "AI explainability" and when is it crucial?**

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**AI Explainability**: The ability to understand and interpret how an AI system makes decisions.

**Crucial for**:

- Healthcare diagnostics
- Financial lending decisions
- Legal/judicial applications
- High-stakes business decisions
- Regulatory compliance (EU AI Act, etc.)

**Less critical for**:

- Content recommendations
- Image generation
- General writing assistance

</details>
