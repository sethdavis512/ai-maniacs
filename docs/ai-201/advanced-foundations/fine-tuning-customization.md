# Fine-tuning & Model Customization

Learn how to adapt AI models for specific use cases through fine-tuning, custom GPTs, and specialized model development techniques that create competitive advantages.

## Understanding Fine-tuning

### What is Fine-tuning?

**Fine-tuning** is the process of taking a pre-trained AI model and adapting it for specific tasks, domains, or use cases by training it on specialized data.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Pre-trained models** provide general language understanding
- **Fine-tuning data** teaches domain-specific knowledge and behavior
- **Transfer learning** leverages existing capabilities while adding specialization
- **Parameter efficiency** achieves customization without full model retraining

### When to Fine-tune vs Prompt Engineering

**Use Fine-tuning When:**

- You need consistent, specialized behavior across many interactions
- Your use case requires domain expertise not in the base model
- You have substantial, high-quality training data available
- Prompt engineering alone doesn't achieve desired performance
- You need to embed proprietary knowledge or processes

**Use Prompt Engineering When:**

- You need quick iteration and experimentation
- Your use case is general-purpose with specific formatting needs
- You have limited training data available
- The base model already has most required knowledge
- You want to maintain flexibility and easy updates

## Fine-tuning Approaches

### Instruction Fine-tuning

**Purpose:** Teaching models to follow specific instruction patterns and formats.

**Example Training Data Format:**

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "You are a customer service agent for TechCorp. Always be helpful, professional, and follow company policies."
    },
    {
      "role": "user", 
      "content": "I want to return this product but I lost my receipt."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "I understand you'd like to return a product without a receipt. Let me help you with that. Can you provide the approximate purchase date and payment method? We can often look up purchases in our system and work out a solution."
    }
  ]
}
```

**Best Practices:**

- Include diverse scenarios and edge cases
- Maintain consistent tone and approach
- Cover error handling and boundary conditions
- Balance helpfulness with policy compliance

### Domain-Specific Fine-tuning

**Medical/Healthcare Example:**

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "You are a medical information assistant. Provide accurate information but always recommend consulting healthcare professionals for medical decisions."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "What are the contraindications for ACE inhibitors?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant", 
      "content": "ACE inhibitors have several important contraindications: pregnancy (due to teratogenic effects), bilateral renal artery stenosis, hyperkalemia, and history of angioedema with ACE inhibitors. They should be used cautiously in patients with kidney disease, as they can affect renal function. Always consult with a healthcare provider before starting or stopping any medication."
    }
  ]
}
```

**Legal/Compliance Example:**

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "You are a compliance assistant for financial services. Provide guidance on regulations but emphasize the need for legal review."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "What are the KYC requirements for new business accounts?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "KYC requirements for business accounts typically include: 1) Business registration documents, 2) Beneficial ownership information (25%+ ownership), 3) Business purpose verification, 4) Source of funds documentation, and 5) Ongoing monitoring procedures. Requirements vary by jurisdiction and risk assessment. Please consult with legal counsel for specific compliance requirements in your jurisdiction."
    }
  ]
}
```
